# Book Search Engine

This is a Google Books API search engine built with a GraphQL API on an Apollo Server. 

The purpose of this project was to take a fully functioning book search engine that was built with a RESTful API and refactor it to use a GraphQL API.

* Modifying existing authentication middleware to work in the context of a GraphQL API
* Creating an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo server

* Using GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify server-side data
* Configuring and deploying a MERN application to Heroku (and, later, Railway)
